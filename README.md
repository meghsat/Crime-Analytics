# Crime-Analytics
Developed a Flask website for real-time crime prediction that predicts the exact crime and displays the details on a map for a given ZIP code and timestamp.

Using present technological advancements, we can predict and analyze crimes with a decent amount of accuracy. We achieve crime prediction with the help of machine learning and deep learning algorithms like K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes classifier, Random Forest classifier, decision trees, and a set of deep learning architectures. For further analytics and visualizations, we use Power BI. The approach's product helps in predicting both crime types and crime locations. Using the Naïve Bayes algorithm, we achieved an accuracy of 40.6% for crime prediction. With the same algorithm, we achieved an accuracy of 25.35% for crime location prediction. <br>
To initialize the web app:
```
python app.py
```

### Interval-based prediction
Instead of generating crime prediction for each and every minute, we facilitated an option to generate a list of crimes between any given timestamps.

### Map visualizations
<ol>
  <li>The Total Crime Count In Each Of The Location Is Mapped Using Their Respective Latitude And Longitude Values.</li>
  <li>The crime that occurred the most per location will also be displayed.</li>
</ol>
